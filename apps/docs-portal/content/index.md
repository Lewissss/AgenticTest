Welcome to the mock documentation portal used to validate AgenticTest. Everything here is static content powered by Eleventy and Lunr, but the navigation flows, anchors, and search interactions mimic a real docs system.

## Goals

- Provide a dense, scroll-heavy page for keyboard navigation tests.
- Expose anchor links, code snippets, and callouts to drive UI selectors.
- Serve as the landing page for `overview` trace replays.

### What’s inside

1. **CLI basics:** Understand commands and flags.
2. **Guides:** Learn how to trace workflows and test playbooks.
3. **Reference:** Configuration schema and API details.

> Because this is strictly a validation site, all data is mocked. Expand sections by editing markdown in `apps/docs-portal/content`.
