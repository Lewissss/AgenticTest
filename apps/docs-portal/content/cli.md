The Agentic CLI (mock) helps automate test workflows. Below is sample content for the docs portal.

## Installation

```bash
bun install -g agentic-cli
```

## Commands

- `agentic init`
- `agentic run`
- `agentic trace list`

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Use `J/K` to navigate headings within the docs portal. This is wired via a small script, giving AgenticTest a keyboard-driven path to verify focus management.
